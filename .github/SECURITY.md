# Security Policy

We take security seriously, and we strive to keep our software as secure as possible.    
That being said, nothing is ever 100% secure, if you've found a potential security issue we'd love to know about it.

### Reporting security issues

If you've found a security issue and wish to discuss it with the team directly, please email us at `security@thesharks.xyz`    
We'll determine a course of action from that point onward, and we'll strive to keep you updated at least once every 2 weeks.    

If you feel like the issue is too minor for email, feel free to open an issue instead.

### Supported versions

Currently we're interested in issues for the current major release, code in the `master` branch, or code in any active development branch.
